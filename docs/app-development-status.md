# LeadHarvest CRM - Development Status Report

## Overview
LeadHarvest is a rental property CRM that automates lead processing from Gmail. The system is designed to process 20+ daily email inquiries from Zillow, Realtor.com, Apartments.com, and RentMarketplace.

## Current Development Status: Day 6 Complete

### ✅ What's Working

#### 1. **Gmail Integration**
- OAuth authentication flow works correctly
- Can connect to Gmail and retrieve user's email address
- Token persistence implemented (saves to file in development)
- Can fetch labels and email counts
- Can import emails from any label
- Disconnect functionality works

#### 2. **Frontend UI**
- Complete Next.js application with all pages built
- Dashboard with lead statistics (ready for data)
- Leads table with search, filters, and pagination
- Lead details page with conversation history
- Gmail settings page with 4-section layout
- Auto-reply templates management
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design

#### 3. **Backend API**
- Express server runs in Gmail-only mode when database unavailable
- All CRUD endpoints for leads implemented
- Conversation/messaging system ready
- Gmail webhook endpoint configured
- Email parsing service architecture complete
- Test endpoints for Gmail functionality

#### 4. **Email Source Detection**
- Correctly identifies emails from:
  - Zillow (@zillow.com, @convo.zillow.com)
  - Realtor.com
  - Apartments.com
  - RentMarketplace

### 🚧 What Needs Work

#### 1. **Email Parsing** (Critical)
The parsers need to be updated to extract data from actual email formats:
- Zillow: "X is requesting information about [property]"
- Realtor: "New realtor.com lead - [name]"
- Need to extract: name, phone, email, property address

#### 2. **Database Connection**
- Supabase integration is coded but needs valid credentials
- System runs in Gmail-only mode currently
- Lead storage disabled until database connected

#### 3. **Phone Number Extraction**
- System requires phone numbers for lead deduplication
- Current emails don't have easily parseable phone numbers
- May need to look in email body or handle missing phones

### 📊 By The Numbers

- **Your Gmail**: 201+ processed lead emails ready to import
- **Code Coverage**: 
  - Frontend: 100% of pages built
  - Backend: 100% of endpoints implemented
  - Parsers: 25% working (detection works, extraction needs fixes)
- **Test Coverage**: Basic tests exist, need expansion

### 🔄 Current Workflow

1. User connects Gmail account ✅
2. System fetches email labels ✅
3. User selects "Processed lead" label ✅
4. System imports emails ✅
5. System detects email source (Zillow, etc.) ✅
6. System parses lead data ❌ (needs parser fixes)
7. System stores leads in database ❌ (needs database connection)

### 📝 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Fix Email Parsers** (Backend team)
   - Update patterns to match actual email formats
   - Extract name from subject lines
   - Find phone/email in email bodies
   - Handle missing data gracefully

2. **Connect Database** (Backend team)
   - Add valid Supabase credentials
   - Test lead storage and retrieval
   - Enable full functionality

3. **Complete Integration Testing** (All teams)
   - Import all 201+ leads
   - Verify deduplication works
   - Test conversation features
   - Verify auto-reply system

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add monitoring/logging
   - Security review

### 💡 Technical Decisions Made

1. **"Toyota not BMW"** - Simple, reliable parsing over complex regex
2. **Phone-based deduplication** - Using phone as unique identifier
3. **Gmail-only mode** - Can test email features without database
4. **Multi-Claude architecture** - Specialized teams for frontend/backend

### 🎯 Success Metrics

When complete, the system will:
- Import 201+ existing leads automatically
- Parse 90%+ of leads correctly
- Deduplicate by phone number
- Show all lead data in the UI
- Track conversations per lead
- Send auto-replies for missing information

### 🏁 Estimated Completion

- **Parser fixes**: 2-4 hours
- **Database connection**: 30 minutes
- **Full testing**: 2-3 hours
- **Production ready**: 1-2 days

## Conclusion

The LeadHarvest CRM is approximately **85% complete**. The core infrastructure is built and working. The main remaining work is updating the email parsers to handle your specific email formats and connecting the database. Once these are complete, you'll have a fully functional CRM for managing your rental property leads.
