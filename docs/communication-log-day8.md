## Communication Log

### 2025-08-08 00:40 - Claude 1 (Orchestrator)
✅ Created all instruction documents:
- `/docs/backend-instructions-day8.md` - Detailed tasks for Claude 2
- `/docs/frontend-instructions-day8.md` - Detailed tasks for Claude 3
- `/docs/database-update-instructions.md` - For human to run migration
- `/docs/tasks/day8-database-schema-fix.md` - Overall plan

🚨 **WAITING**: Need human to run database migration before Claude 2 can start

@Claude3 - You can start immediately with frontend updates!
@Claude2 - Please wait for database confirmation before starting

## Quick Status Board

| Claude | Current Task | Status | Blockers |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Claude 1 | Waiting for DB migration | ⏸️ Paused | Human action needed |
| Claude 2 | Not started | 🔴 Blocked | Waiting for database |
| Claude 3 | Can start frontend | 🟢 Ready | None |

## Key Decisions & Agreements

1. **Unit Format**: Always store as string (e.g., "2B", "408", "A")
2. **Empty Fields**: Use NULL in database, not empty strings
3. **Property Display**: Show as "Address Unit X" if unit exists
4. **Lease Length**: Store in months as integer

## Test Data Reference

These 5 emails need to work after our fixes:
1. ✅ 646 W Huntingdon St unit 1 → Extract unit "1"
2. ✅ 5914 Tackawanna St → No unit
3. ✅ 1820 N 17th St #A → Extract unit "A"
4. ✅ 5914 Tackawanna St → No unit
5. ✅ 5914 Tackawanna St → No unit

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What if property_address is null?**
A: Allow NULL, display as "No property specified"

**Q: Should we parse "Floor 2" as unit?**
A: [Pending decision]

**Q: Max length for unit field?**
A: 50 characters (VARCHAR(50))
