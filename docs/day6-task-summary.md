# Day 6 Task Summary - End of Day

## Completed Today

### Orchestrator (Claude 1)
✅ Tested all Gmail endpoints - all working correctly
✅ Identified misleading "404 error" in frontend (actually returns 200 OK)
✅ Discovered 201+ processed lead emails in Gmail
✅ Diagnosed parser issues preventing lead extraction
✅ Created terminal testing scripts for Gmail integration
✅ Assigned fix tasks to Backend and Frontend teams

### Key Findings
1. **Gmail Integration Works**: OAuth, import, status, disconnect all functional
2. **You have 201+ leads**: In "Processed lead" label ready to import
3. **Parser Issue**: System doesn't recognize @convo.zillow.com emails
4. **Frontend Issue**: Shows "404" error even when import succeeds

## Current Tasks

### Backend (Claude 2) - In Progress
Working on: `/docs/tasks/backend-fix-parsers.md`
- Fix email source detector to recognize @convo.zillow.com
- Update parsers to extract name, phone, property from actual email formats
- Add patterns for "X is requesting information about Y" format
- Fix Realtor.com lead parsing

### Frontend (Claude 3) - Assigned
Working on: `/docs/tasks/frontend-fix-error-display.md`
- Fix error message showing "404" when import actually succeeds
- Improve error handling to show actual backend messages
- Display import results even when parsing fails
- Add helpful console output for debugging

## Expected Outcomes

Once both teams complete their fixes:
1. Frontend will show correct success/error messages
2. Backend will parse leads correctly extracting:
   - Lead name (e.g., "Ernestine Griffin")
   - Phone number (for deduplication)
   - Email address
   - Property address
   - Source (zillow, realtor, etc.)
3. You'll be able to import all 201+ processed leads with proper data extraction

## Next Steps

1. Wait for Claude 2 to fix parsers
2. Wait for Claude 3 to fix error display
3. Test full import of processed leads
4. Verify data extraction works correctly
5. Begin using the system for real lead management!
