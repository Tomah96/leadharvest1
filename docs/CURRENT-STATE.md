# Current System State - LeadHarvest
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-28 17:30 by Claude 3 (Frontend)

## 🟢 What's Working
- ✅ **Backend Server**: Running on localhost:3001 using main `server.js`
- ✅ **Frontend Server**: Running on localhost:3003 (Next.js dev server)
- ✅ **CORS Configuration**: Backend allows requests from ports 3000, 3002, and 3003
- ✅ **Supabase Connection**: Database fully connected and operational
- ✅ **Gmail OAuth**: Connected to toma@plusrealtors.com and actively importing
- ✅ **Lead Management**: Full CRUD operations with leads in database
- ✅ **Email Parsing**: All 4 sources working (Zillow, Realtor, Apartments, RentMarketplace)
- ✅ **Tour Date Extraction**: TourDateParser handles 20+ date/time formats
- ✅ **Lead Display**: Frontend showing leads with pagination
- ✅ **Lead Details Page**: Full implementation with enhanced UI
- ✅ **Bulk Operations**: Selection and bulk delete functionality
- ✅ **Name Parsing**: Correctly extracting first/last names
- ✅ **Deduplication**: Phone-based dedup working with email fallback
- ✅ **Credit Score Ranges**: Database stores ranges like "660-719"
- ✅ **Message Templates**: CRUD operations, smart variables, preview (FIXED 2025-08-28)
- ✅ **Conversation Seeding**: Initial inquiry stored as first message

## ✅ Issues Resolved
- ~~Using `backend-full.js` workaround~~ → Now using main `server.js`
- ~~Supabase connection issues~~ → Database fully connected
- ~~Credit score INTEGER constraint~~ → Changed to VARCHAR(50) for ranges
- ~~Phone extraction returning 9999999999~~ → Fixed HTML parsing logic
- ~~"templates.map is not a function"~~ → Fixed type definitions and require placement (2025-08-28)

## 🚀 Next Steps for Any Claude
1. Clean up workaround files listed above
2. Migrate from `backend-full.js` to proper `server.js`
3. Continue with any pending feature development
4. Always update ACTIVE-WORK-LOG.md after completing tasks

## 💡 Remember
- The codebase is COMPLETE - don't recreate features
- Check import paths and env vars first when debugging  
- No workarounds - fix root causes
- Document everything in ACTIVE-WORK-LOG.md
