## Task Status Flow

```
PENDING ‚Üí ASSIGNED ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí READY_FOR_REVIEW ‚Üí COMPLETE

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Drop everything - Production down or blocking all work
- **P1**: Complete today - Core feature or major blocker
- **P2**: Complete this week - Important but not urgent
- **P3**: Backlog - Nice to have or technical debt

### Reporting a Blocker
```markdown
### P[0-3] [Agent] [Time] - [Brief Title]
**Issue**: [Clear description]
**Error**: [Error message if applicable]
**Impact**: [What's blocked]
**Attempted**: [What you tried]
**Need**: [What would unblock you]
@[blocking-agent]
```

### Asking a Question

## Communication Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Update status immediately when starting/completing tasks
- Document decisions with rationale
- Include file paths when mentioning code changes
- Tag other agents when you need them
- Create progress reports even for partial work

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Leave blockers undocumented
- Make major decisions without documenting
- Skip end-of-session reports
- Ignore messages in communication log
- Work on tasks not in daily-assignments.md

## Emergency Procedures

### P0 Issue Response
1. **STOP** current work
2. **POST** in AGENT-COMMUNICATION-LOG.md with @all
3. **CREATE** incident report in /docs/incidents/
4. **UPDATE** blockers-and-issues.md with P0 flag
5. **FIX** with minimal change
6. **TEST** thoroughly
7. **DOCUMENT** root cause

### Can't Access Documentation
```bash
# Backup access paths
cat /mnt/c/Users/12158/LeadHarvest/docs/AGENT-COMMUNICATION-LOG.md
cat /mnt/c/Users/12158/LeadHarvest/docs/system-state.md
ls -la /mnt/c/Users/12158/LeadHarvest/docs/progress-reports/
```

## Useful Commands
