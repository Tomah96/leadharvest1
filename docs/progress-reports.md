### Achievements

#### Morning Session (09:00-12:00)
- **Fixed Critical Supabase Bug**: 
  - Problem: ".eq is not a function" preventing all lead imports
  - Root Cause: Wrong import path + env var timing issue
  - Solution: 2-line fix (changed import + lazy initialization)
  - Impact: Gmail import now fully functional
  - Lesson: 4-hour debug that should've been 30 minutes

#### Afternoon Session (14:00-17:00)
- **Implemented Lead Details Page**:
  - Backend: Fixed API validation bug (expected UUID, got numeric IDs)
  - Frontend: Fixed response unwrapping issue
  - Result: Full navigation from list to details working

- **Fixed Email Parsing Bugs**:
  - Problem: Names extracted incorrectly (showing "RentMarketplace." as first name)
  - Solution: Updated all 4 parsers with correct regex patterns
  - Result: Lead 299 now correctly shows "Tynesia Clanton"
  - Impact: All future imports will have correct data

#### Evening Session (17:00-18:00)

🔧 **Current Issue: Processing Queue Test Design**
- Created comprehensive tests for Gmail service (16 passing)
- Processing queue tests have 1 failing test due to design issue:
  - Queue automatically starts processing when emails are enqueued
  - Tests expect to inspect queue in "paused" state
  - Position calculation returns 0 instead of 1 (empty queue after processing starts)
  
**Question for Orchestrator**: Should we:
1. Modify processingQueue to have optional manual start for testing?
2. Fix the test to work with auto-processing behavior?
3. Leave as-is since 16/17 tests pass and functionality works?

## 2025-08-27 - Zillow Parser Critical Fixes (Claude 2 - Backend)

### Summary
Fixed critical data quality issues in Zillow parser that were causing misleading information display, particularly for the Maryorie lead (ID 574).

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. ✅ Pets Field "Not answered" Handling
- **Before**: Showed "No pets" when email said "Not answered"
- **After**: Returns `null` for "Not answered", "N/A", or "Not provided"
- **Impact**: Frontend can now show "Not provided" instead of misleading "No pets"

#### 2. ✅ Occupants Default Value
- **Before**: Defaulted to 0 when not provided
- **After**: Returns `null` when missing
- **Impact**: Shows "Not provided" instead of "0 occupants"

#### 3. ✅ Inquiry Message Extraction
- **Before**: Missing valuable lead context
- **After**: Captures inquiry text like "I'm interested in your property..."
- **Impact**: Sales team can see lead's initial request

#### 4. ✅ Credit Score Range Preservation
- **Before**: Only storing midpoint (690 for "660-719")
- **After**: Stores full range in metadata.credit_score_range
- **Impact**: Full credit range available for qualification

#### 5. ✅ Inquiry Date Fix
- **Before**: Showing "Inquired -1 days ago" due to date issues
- **After**: Properly uses email date/time as inquiry_date
- **Impact**: Accurate timeline tracking

### Files Modified
- `/backend/src/parsers/zillowParser.js` - All parser fixes
