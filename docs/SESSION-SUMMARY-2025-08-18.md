# Session Summary - August 18, 2025
**Claude 1 (Orchestrator)**

## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. Fixed Zillow Parser Name Extraction ✅
**Problem**: Names were showing as "96" or "Unknown" in the leads list
**Root Cause**: Parser was extracting from subject line incorrectly
**Solution**: 
- Updated parser to extract sender name from email "from" field
- Format: `Ashlie Conboy <email@convo.zillow.com>` → extracts "Ashlie Conboy"
- Falls back to body parsing only if sender name invalid
- Much simpler and more reliable than complex regex patterns

**Files Modified**:
- `/backend/src/parsers/zillowParser.js` - Added sender name extraction

### 2. Fixed Date Display ✅
**Problem**: Dates showing as "Today", "Yesterday", "-1 days ago"
**Solution**: Changed to show actual date/time (e.g., "8/15/2025, 3:30 PM")

**Files Modified**:
- `/frontend/src/components/leads/LeadCard.tsx` - Simplified formatLeadDate()

### 3. Cleaned Database ✅
- Deleted 8 leads with bad data ("96" or empty names)
- Backend restarted with updated parser
- Ready for clean imports

### 4. Created Phase 2 Implementation Plan ✅
Comprehensive plan for:
- Deployment to Vercel/Railway
- Real-time Gmail sync
- Two-way communication (email/SMS)
- OpenPhone integration
- Tour scheduling with Google Calendar

**Documentation Created**:
- `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-PHASE2.md` - Full implementation roadmap
- `/docs/SESSION-SUMMARY-2025-08-18.md` - This summary

## Current System State

### Running Processes
- Backend: Running on localhost:3001 (bash_1)
- Frontend: Ready to start on localhost:3000

### Parser Status
- ✅ Zillow: Extracts from sender name
- ✅ Realtor: Working
- ✅ Apartments: Working  
- ✅ RentMarketplace: Working

### Key Fixes Applied
1. Sender name extraction in zillowParser.js
2. Date display showing actual date/time
3. Database cleaned of bad leads

## Next Steps (User Action Required)

### Tonight
1. Create Vercel account for frontend deployment
2. Create Railway account for backend deployment
3. Share OpenPhone webhook code from previous app

### Tomorrow (with Claude 2 & 3)
1. Deploy to production
2. Set up Gmail Push Notifications
3. Build conversation UI
4. Implement message sending

## Questions Pending User Response

1. **Gmail Watch**: Should we watch ALL emails or just those with "processed-lead" label?
2. **OpenPhone**: Can you share your existing webhook handler code?
3. **Tour Conflicts**: First-come-first-served or qualification-based priority?
4. **Draft Management**: Should drafts auto-expire after X hours?
5. **Property Mapping**: How do you map email inquiries to specific properties/units?

## Key Decisions Made

Based on user feedback:
- ✅ Use Vercel for frontend (free tier)
- ✅ Automatic real-time sync (not manual)
- ✅ Immediate acknowledgment (as drafts)
- ✅ 1-4 agents handling tours
- ✅ Time windows (3-6pm) not specific slots
- ✅ Build email/SMS composer in app
- ✅ Use templates, not AI (for now)

## Files to Keep

All files in `/docs/` - especially:
- `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-PHASE2.md`
- `CURRENT-STATE.md`
- `DEBUGGING-PRINCIPLES.md`
- `lessons/` folder

## Files That Can Be Deleted

After deployment, can remove:
- `/backend/gmail-server.js`
- `/backend/backend-full.js`
- `/backend/simple-server.js`
- `/backend/test-*.js`
- Various test HTML files in root

---

**Handoff Notes for Next Claude Instance**:
1. Read `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-PHASE2.md` first
2. User wants aggressive timeline - move fast
3. User has existing OpenPhone webhook code to share
4. Deployment is priority #1
5. Backend is running (bash_1) and working correctly
