# Orchestrator Task: Integration Testing and Documentation
**Assigned to**: Orchestrator Claude (Claude 1)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - After both implementations complete
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Dependencies**: Backend API + Frontend UI complete

## 📋 Task Overview
Perform end-to-end integration testing of the bulk operations feature, document the API, and ensure quality across the full stack.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bulk operations work with 50+ leads
- [ ] UI correctly reflects backend state
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance acceptable with 100+ leads
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Cross-browser testing passed
- [ ] Mobile responsive verified

## 🧪 Integration Testing Tasks

### 1. End-to-End Test Scenarios (30 min)

#### Scenario 1: Basic Bulk Delete
```
1. Load leads page (verify 50+ leads shown)
2. Select 5 leads using checkboxes
3. Click "Delete Selected"
4. Confirm deletion
5. Verify leads removed from UI
6. Verify database updated
7. Check total count updated
```

#### Scenario 2: Select All and Delete
```
1. Click "Select All"
2. Verify all visible leads selected
3. Click "Delete Selected"
4. Cancel confirmation (verify nothing deleted)
5. Click "Delete Selected" again
6. Confirm deletion
7. Verify all selected leads removed
```

#### Scenario 3: Pagination Limits
```
1. Test with limit=20 (verify 20 shown)
2. Change to limit=50 (verify 50 shown)
3. Change to limit=100 (verify up to 100)
4. Change to "All" (verify all leads shown)
5. Check performance with each limit
```

#### Scenario 4: Error Handling
```
1. Attempt to delete non-existent lead
2. Verify partial success handling
3. Test network failure during delete
4. Verify UI recovery after error
```

#### Scenario 5: Mixed Operations
```
1. Search for specific leads
2. Select filtered results
3. Delete selected
4. Clear search
5. Verify correct leads deleted
```

### 2. Performance Testing (15 min)

Create test script:
```javascript
// test-performance.js
async function testPerformance() {
  console.time('Load 100 leads');
  await fetch('/api/leads?limit=100');
  console.timeEnd('Load 100 leads');
  
  console.time('Bulk delete 50 leads');
  await fetch('/api/leads/bulk-delete', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ ids: Array.from({length: 50}, (_, i) => i + 1) })
  });
  console.timeEnd('Bulk delete 50 leads');
}
```

Performance Targets:
- Load 50 leads: < 500ms
- Load 100 leads: < 1s
- Bulk delete 10 leads: < 500ms
- Bulk delete 50 leads: < 2s
- UI update after deletion: < 100ms

### 3. Cross-Browser Testing (10 min)

Test on:
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (if available)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Chrome
- [ ] Mobile Safari

Verify:
- Checkboxes render correctly
- Selection state persists
- Bulk operations work
- Responsive layout correct

### 4. API Documentation (15 min)

    await fetch('/api/leads', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        first_name: `Test${i}`,
        last_name: `Lead${i}`,
        phone: `555000${String(i).padStart(4, '0')}`,
        email: `test${i}@example.com`,
        source: ['zillow', 'realtor', 'apartments'][i % 3],
