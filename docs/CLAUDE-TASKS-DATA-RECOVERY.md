# Task Delegation: Fix Missing Lead Data
**Created**: 2025-08-10 by Orchestrator Claude
**Issue**: 48 out of 50 leads are missing their data because raw emails weren't saved

## üö® ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### The Problem:
1. **Only 2 leads have raw email content** (302 and 252) out of 50 total
2. **NO Gmail message IDs saved** - can't re-fetch from Gmail
3. **Original import process was flawed**:
   - Tried to parse HTML emails
   - Failed and saved HTML fragments in notes
   - Did NOT save the original email for re-parsing
   - Did NOT save Gmail message IDs for recovery

### Why Lead 302 Works:
- Backend Claude manually updated it WITH raw email in metadata
- The parser can then extract all the data
- Other leads have no raw email to parse!

## üîß BACKEND CLAUDE TASKS (Priority 1)

### Task 1: Create Manual Update Script (2 hours)
Since we can't recover from Gmail (no message IDs), create a script to manually update leads with email content.

**File**: `/backend/scripts/update-lead-with-email.js`

```javascript
// Script to update a lead with raw email content and re-parse
const leadId = process.argv[2];
const emailContent = process.argv[3]; // or read from file

// 1. Update lead with raw email in metadata
// 2. Run parser on the email
// 3. Update all fields in database
```

### Task 2: Fix Daniela Lin (Lead 301) First
Using the email content provided by user:
```
Subject: Daniela Lin is requesting information about 1741 Fontain St #3

Daniela Lin says:
Hi Toma Holovatskyy, My partner, his mom, and I are moving from Chicago...

Move in: Aug 15, 2025
Credit score: 660 to 719
Pets: No
Lease Length: 12 months
Number of Bedrooms: 2
Number of Occupants: 3
```

Update lead 301 with:
- last_name: "Lin"
- notes: The actual message
- credit_score: "660-719"
- move_in_date: "2025-08-15"
- occupants: 3
- preferred_bedrooms: 2
- lease_length: 12
- metadata: Store raw email

### Task 3: Fix Import Process (1 hour)
Update `/backend/src/controllers/gmailController.js`:
1. ALWAYS save raw email content in metadata
2. ALWAYS save Gmail message ID
3. Add error handling for parse failures
4. Keep original email even if parsing fails

## üé® FRONTEND CLAUDE TASKS (Priority 2)

### Task 1: Add Data Quality Dashboard (1 hour)
Create a view showing:
```typescript
// Component to show data quality
const DataQualityDashboard = () => {
  // Show:
  // - Total leads: 50
  // - Complete data: 2
  // - Missing data: 48
  // - List of affected leads
}
```

### Task 2: Add Manual Update UI (1.5 hours)
Create interface to paste email content:
```typescript
// Allow user to paste email content
// Send to backend update endpoint
// Re-parse and display results
```

### Task 3: Visual Indicators (30 min)
In lead list and details:
- Red badge for "Missing Data"
- Yellow badge for "Partial Data"
- Green badge for "Complete"
- "Fix Data" button for affected leads

### Task 2: Coordinate Fix Process
1. Backend creates update script
2. Test with Daniela Lin first
3. Frontend adds UI for manual updates
4. Process remaining leads

### Task 3: Prevent Future Issues
Ensure import process changes are tested
