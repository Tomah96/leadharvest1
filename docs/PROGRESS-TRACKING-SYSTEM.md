# LeadHarvest Progress Tracking System

## Overview

This document defines our comprehensive progress tracking and knowledge sharing system for the LeadHarvest project. It ensures perfect synchronization between all Claude agents (Orchestrator, Backend, Frontend) and maintains a clear record of work completed, in progress, and planned.

## System Components

### 1. Core Documentation Files

- **COORDINATION_SYSTEM.md** - Live coordination protocols and current status
- **KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md** - Accumulated wisdom and solutions
- **AGENT-COMMUNICATION-LOG.md** - Inter-agent updates and decisions

#### Daily Operations
- **daily-assignments.md** - Current day's tasks for all agents
- **progress-reports/** - Daily progress reports from each agent
- **blockers-and-issues.md** - Current blockers requiring attention
- **system-state.md** - Current deployment and system status

#### Task Management

- **testing-results/** - Test execution results and coverage reports
- **incidents/** - Production incident reports and RCAs

## Progress Reporting Protocol

### Daily Progress Report Template

Each agent creates a daily report in `/docs/progress-reports/[date]-[agent]-report.md`:

```markdown
# [Agent] Progress Report - [Date]

## Session Summary
- **Start Time**: [HH:MM timezone]
- **End Time**: [HH:MM timezone]
- **Focus Area**: [Main area worked on]
- **Overall Status**: [ðŸŸ¢ On Track | ðŸŸ¡ Minor Issues | ðŸ”´ Blocked]

## Completed Tasks

## Communication Protocols

### 1. Morning Sync Protocol

Each agent starts their session by:

1. **Check System State**
   ```bash
   # Read current system status
   /docs/system-state.md
   /docs/blockers-and-issues.md
   ```

2. **Review Assignments**
   ```bash
   /docs/daily-assignments.md
   /docs/tasks/[agent]-day[N].md
   ```

3. **Check Questions**
   ```bash
   /docs/AGENT-COMMUNICATION-LOG.md
   /docs/questions/
   ```

4. **Update Status**
   - Mark tasks as "IN_PROGRESS" in daily-assignments.md
   - Add session start entry to AGENT-COMMUNICATION-LOG.md

### 2. During Work Protocol

#### When Starting a Task
1. Update task status to "IN_PROGRESS"
2. Create feature branch if needed
3. Document approach in communication log

#### When Completing a Task
1. Run tests and document results
2. Update task status to "READY_FOR_REVIEW"
3. Add completion entry to progress report
4. Check for integration impacts

#### When Blocked
1. Immediately update blockers-and-issues.md
2. Tag blocking agent in AGENT-COMMUNICATION-LOG.md
3. Document workaround attempts
4. Escalate if P0/P1 priority

### 3. End of Session Protocol

1. **Create Progress Report**
   - Use template above
   - Save to `/docs/progress-reports/[date]-[agent]-report.md`

2. **Update Central Documents**
   - Update KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md with learnings
   - Update tech-debt-tracker.md if debt incurred
   - Update system-state.md with current status

3. **Prepare Handoff**
   - Clear description of work state
   - Any partial work clearly marked
   - Next steps documented

## Task Status Lifecycle

```
PENDING â†’ ASSIGNED â†’ IN_PROGRESS â†’ READY_FOR_REVIEW â†’ IN_REVIEW â†’ COMPLETE
                â†“                           â†“
            BLOCKED                  NEEDS_REVISION
                                           â†“
                                    IN_PROGRESS
```

### Status Definitions
