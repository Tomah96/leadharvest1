# NPM Recovery - Claude 2 Status Update

## Time: 15:00

### ✅ Completed:
1. **Checked for NPM cache** - No cached packages found in /tmp
2. **Checked frontend packages** - Only axios exists, copied to backend
3. **Tested npx** - Works but can't find packages
4. **Created automated restoration script** - `/backend/restore-packages.sh`
5. **Tested restoration script** - Downloads packages successfully but Express needs more dependencies

### 📊 Test Results:
- ✅ Script successfully downloads packages
- ✅ Main packages installed (express, dotenv, cors, helmet, morgan, etc.)
- ⚠️ Express missing nested dependencies: `ms`, `object-assign`, `ee-first`
- ✅ Manually added `ms` and `object-assign`

### 🎯 Available for Claude 1:
**Automated Package Restoration Script**: `/backend/restore-packages.sh`
- Downloads 30+ packages automatically
- Works but needs additional dependencies
- Faster than manual download

### 📝 Missing Dependencies Found:
Express needs these additional packages:
- `ee-first`
- `ms` (already added)
- `object-assign` (already added)
- Likely more...

### 🔄 Current Status:
The restoration approach works but Express has MANY nested dependencies. We might need:
1. Continue adding missing packages one by one
2. OR use the pure Node.js server (full-server-with-db.js) which already works

### 💡 Recommendation:
For investor demo, use `full-server-with-db.js` (already working) and add mock Gmail endpoints rather than trying to restore all Express dependencies.
