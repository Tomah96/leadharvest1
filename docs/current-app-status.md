# Current LeadHarvest App Status
*Updated: August 8, 2025 2:50 PM*

## Working Features ✅

### Backend (Pure Node Server - full-server-with-db.js)
- **Server:** Running on port 3001 (no NPM dependencies!)
- **Database:** Connected via Supabase REST API
- **Health Check:** `/api/health` - Working
- **Lead Management:**
  - GET `/api/leads` - Working (returns leads from database)
  - POST `/api/leads` - Working (creates new leads)
  - PATCH `/api/leads/:id` - Working (updates leads)
  - DELETE `/api/leads/:id` - Working
- **Gmail Mock Endpoints:**
  - `/api/gmail/status` - Returns connected status
  - `/api/gmail/auth-url` - Returns mock auth URL
  - `/api/gmail/test/mock-import` - Imports test leads
- **Address Parser:** Extracts unit numbers from addresses
- **Test Data:** 3 test leads imported successfully

### Frontend
- Running on port 3000
- UI loads without critical errors
- Lead list page accessible
- Settings page accessible

## Known Issues ⚠️

### Backend
- Original server.js not working (missing bcrypt, googleapis modules)
- NPM install completely broken (hangs indefinitely)
- Using workaround server instead of original

### Frontend  
- Gmail connection shows errors due to path mismatch
- Expects `/gmail/auth-url` but backend provides `/api/gmail/auth-url`
- Claude 3 is fixing this issue

## Current Workarounds

1. **Database:** Using direct Supabase REST API instead of client library
2. **Server:** Using pure Node.js server without NPM dependencies
3. **Gmail:** Mock endpoints for demo purposes
4. **Auth:** No authentication required (simplified for demo)
