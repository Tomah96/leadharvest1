## In Progress Tasks

### Task: Daily Progress Report Creation (Priority: P1)
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ 90% Complete
- **Expected Completion**: 09:35 UTC
- **Current Focus**: Finalizing this report
- **Blockers**: None

## Discovered Issues

### Issue 1: Database Connection Not Working
- **Severity**: High
- **Impact**: Lead management features disabled
- **Proposed Solution**: Continue with Gmail-only mode for now, investigate Supabase credentials
- **Files Affected**: Backend API endpoints
- **Assigned To**: Backend team (when available)

### Issue 2: Low Frontend Test Coverage
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Impact**: Risk of regression bugs
- **Proposed Solution**: Prioritize test writing for critical components
- **Files Affected**: Frontend components
- **Assigned To**: Frontend team

## Questions for Other Agents

### For Backend Agent:
1. **Question**: Can you verify the Supabase connection string format?
   - **Context**: System can't connect to database
   - **Blocking**: No (Gmail-only mode works)

### For Frontend Agent:
1. **Question**: Are the Gmail import components ready for integration testing?
   - **Context**: Need to verify end-to-end flow
   - **Blocking**: No

## Knowledge Gained

### Learning 1: Progress Visibility
- **Discovery**: Lack of structured reporting causes coordination issues
- **Application**: New template-based system ensures nothing falls through cracks
- **Documentation Updated**: Yes - PROGRESS-TRACKING-SYSTEM.md created

### Learning 2: System State Importance
- **Discovery**: Agents need quick way to check environment status
- **Application**: system-state.md provides at-a-glance health check
- **Documentation Updated**: Yes - system-state.md created

## Tomorrow's Priorities

1. **Monitor Gmail Integration Testing** - Coordinate frontend/backend testing (P0)
2. **Review Progress Reports** - Ensure all agents using new templates (P1)
3. **Address Database Issue** - Work with backend to fix Supabase (P1)
4. **Update Test Strategy** - Plan for improving test coverage (P2)

## Metrics
- **Commits**: 0 (documentation focus)
- **Tests Written**: 0
- **Tests Passing**: N/A
- **Coverage Change**: 0%
- **Files Modified**: 6
- **Lines Changed**: +800/-20

## Session Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive progress tracking system that addresses coordination gaps identified in previous days. The new system provides:

1. **Clear Templates** - Standardized reporting across all agents
2. **Real-time Communication** - AGENT-COMMUNICATION-LOG.md for immediate updates
3. **System Visibility** - system-state.md shows environment health
4. **Knowledge Retention** - Enhanced knowledge base with practical examples

All agents should now use these new systems for better coordination and knowledge sharing. The templates ensure consistent, thorough reporting that captures both progress and learnings.

Next critical step is to monitor the Gmail integration testing between frontend and backend teams to ensure successful end-to-end functionality.
