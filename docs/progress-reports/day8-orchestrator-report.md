# Day 8 Orchestrator Progress Report

**Date**: 2025-07-26
**Claude**: Claude 1 (Orchestrator)
**Focus**: Creating tasks for Gmail-only lead display

## Summary

Created comprehensive Day 8 tasks for both backend and frontend teams to implement in-memory lead storage, enabling the display of parsed Gmail leads without requiring database setup.

## Tasks Created

### Backend Day 8 Tasks
**File**: `/docs/tasks/backend-day8-gmail-only.md`

1. **In-Memory Lead Storage**
   - Create MemoryLeadStore class with full CRUD operations
   - Phone-based deduplication
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Stats tracking

2. **Service Updates**
   - Modify leadService.js to use memory store when database unavailable
   - Update leadModel.js with memory store fallback
   - Add import-to-memory endpoint

3. **Testing Commands**
   - Provided curl commands for testing all endpoints
   - Memory persistence during server session

### Frontend Day 8 Tasks
**File**: `/docs/tasks/frontend-day8-display-leads.md`

1. **Gmail-Only Mode UI**
   - Dashboard banner for database-free mode
   - Import button on leads page
   - Success notifications

2. **Lead Display Enhancements**
   - Fix pagination null errors
   - Show placeholder phone indicators
   - Quick phone edit modal

3. **Stats Widget**
   - Lead counts by source
   - Needs-phone counter
   - Real-time updates

## Implementation Plan
**File**: `/docs/day8-implementation-plan.md`

- Chose Option B: Gmail-only UI based on Claude 2's suggestions
- Backend implements memory store first
- Frontend connects to display leads
- Full CRUD operations without database

## Key Decisions

1. **Memory Storage**: Server-side Map structure for lead storage
2. **Phone as Key**: Using phone number for deduplication
3. **Placeholder Handling**: "9999999999" for missing phones
4. **Session Persistence**: Data persists until server restart

## Expected Outcomes

After implementation:
- Import emails from Gmail â†’ Store in memory
- View all leads in leads page
- Edit placeholder phone numbers
- Full CRM functionality without database
- Clear upgrade path to database later

## Next Steps

1. Monitor Claude 2's implementation of memory store
2. Monitor Claude 3's UI updates
3. Test full import â†’ display flow
4. Document any issues or blockers
