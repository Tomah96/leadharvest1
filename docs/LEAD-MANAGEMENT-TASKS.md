# Lead Management Features - Task Delegation
**Created**: 2025-08-09 15:00 by Backend Claude
**Purpose**: Add bulk operations and improve lead display for LeadHarvest CRM
**Status**: üöÄ Implementation Phase

## üìä Current Issues
1. **Only showing 20 leads** - Frontend hardcoded to limit: 20 (should show 50+)
2. **No bulk operations** - Can only delete one lead at a time
3. **No selection UI** - Missing checkboxes and multi-select functionality
4. **Database has 50+ leads** - But UI only displays 20

## üéØ Feature Requirements
User wants a "Manage" button on leads page with:
- Add lead manually (already exists)
- Select individual leads (checkboxes)
- Select all leads
- Delete selected leads (bulk operation)
- Display all 50+ leads (not just 20)

---

## üìÅ Files to Modify/Create

### Backend Files:
```
/backend/src/routes/leadRoutes.js         - Add bulk delete route
/backend/src/controllers/leadController.js - Add bulk delete controller
/backend/src/services/leadService.js      - Add bulk delete service
/backend/src/models/leadModel.js          - Add bulk delete query
/backend/test-bulk-delete.js              - NEW: Test script
```

### Frontend Files:
```
/frontend/src/app/leads/page.tsx          - Selection state, pagination
/frontend/src/components/leads/LeadCard.tsx - Add checkbox
/frontend/src/components/leads/LeadManagementToolbar.tsx - NEW: Toolbar
/frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts           - Add bulk delete call
/frontend/src/types/index.ts              - Add selection types
```

---

## üöÄ Implementation Timeline

```
Hour 0-2:   Backend implements bulk delete API
Hour 2-2.5: Backend testing & documentation
Hour 2.5:   Backend posts API ready signal
Hour 2.5-5: Frontend implements UI changes
Hour 5-5.5: Frontend testing
Hour 5.5-6: Integration testing by Orchestrator
Hour 6:     Feature complete and tested
```

## üìù Communication Protocol

1. **Use AGENT-COMMUNICATION-LOG.md** for status updates
2. **Update ACTIVE-WORK-LOG.md** after completing tasks
3. **Report blockers in blockers-and-issues.md**
4. **Tag relevant Claude in messages** (@Backend, @Frontend, @Orchestrator)

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The feature is complete when:
- [ ] User can see all 50+ leads (not just 20)
- [ ] User can select individual leads with checkboxes
- [ ] User can select all leads at once
- [ ] User can delete multiple selected leads
- [ ] Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- [ ] UI updates immediately after bulk operations
- [ ] Error handling for partial failures
- [ ] Performance remains good with 100+ leads

## üî• Current Status

**Backend Claude (Claude 2)**: Starting implementation NOW
**Frontend Claude (Claude 3)**: Waiting for backend API
**Orchestrator (Claude 1)**: Monitoring progress

---

## üí¨ Notes

- Backend should prioritize bulk delete endpoint first
- Frontend can start on selection UI while waiting for API
- Use existing patterns from codebase
- Keep it simple - "Toyota not BMW" philosophy
- Test with actual data (50+ leads in database)
