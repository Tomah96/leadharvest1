# Tech Debt Tracker

## Purpose
Track technical debt items to ensure they're addressed before they become problems. Each item should have a clear impact assessment and remediation plan.

## Debt Classification
- 🔴 **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities or major performance issues
- 🟡 **High**: Impacts maintainability or scalability
- 🟢 **Low**: Nice-to-have improvements

## Current Tech Debt

### ✅ [DEBT-001] No Automated Testing (RESOLVED)
**Added**: 2025-07-16
**Resolved**: 2025-07-17
**Component**: All
**Description**: No test suite implemented yet
**Impact**: Risk of regressions, harder debugging
**Resolution Applied**: 
1. ✅ Added Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
2. ✅ Created comprehensive test utilities and setup

4. ⏳ Backend already has tests (23 passing)
**Final Status**: Frontend testing infrastructure complete, ongoing coverage expansion

### 🟢 [DEBT-002] No Request Rate Limiting
**Added**: 2025-07-16
**Component**: Backend
**Description**: API endpoints lack rate limiting
**Impact**: Potential for abuse/DOS
**Remediation Plan**: 
1. Implement express-rate-limit
2. Configure per-endpoint limits
**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours

### ✅ [DEBT-003] No Loading States (RESOLVED)
**Added**: 2025-07-17
**Resolved**: 2025-07-17
**Component**: Frontend
**Description**: Components don't show loading states during data fetching
**Impact**: Poor user experience during async operations
**Resolution Applied**: 
1. ✅ Created LoadingSpinner component with multiple sizes
2. ✅ Added loading states to all data fetching operations
3. ✅ Implemented throughout leads, dashboard, and conversations
**Final Status**: Comprehensive loading states implemented

### 🟢 [DEBT-004] No Error Boundaries
**Added**: 2025-07-17
**Component**: Frontend
**Description**: No error boundaries to catch React component errors
**Impact**: Full app crash on component errors
**Remediation Plan**: 
1. Implement error boundary wrapper component
2. Add to page-level components
3. Create fallback UI for error states
**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours

**Resolution Applied**: 
1. ✅ Replaced all mock data with real API calls
2. ✅ Added proper data fetching hooks (useApi, usePaginatedApi)
3. ✅ Dashboard and leads page now use real backend data
**Final Status**: All pages connected to real backend APIs

### 🟢 [DEBT-006] Test Coverage Gap
**Added**: 2025-07-17
**Component**: Frontend
**Description**: Test coverage needs to reach 80% target
**Impact**: Incomplete test coverage for full confidence
**Remediation Plan**: 
1. Add tests for remaining components (LeadForm, SearchBar, etc.)
