# Backend Fixes Session - 2025-08-15
**Role**: Claude 2 (Backend Developer)
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Session Summary
Fixed critical parser bugs causing "96" to be extracted as names, date/timezone issues, and missing email patterns. All fixes tested and verified working.

## Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Date/Time Inconsistency ("-1 days ago" bug)
**Problem**: Dates showing in the future, causing negative day calculations
- `parseDate()` was stripping time with `.split('T')[0]` at line 363
- Direct date assignment kept full timestamp, causing inconsistency

**Fix Applied**: Line 355-371 in `zillowParser.js`
```javascript
// Now keeps full ISO timestamp
return parsed.toISOString(); // Instead of .split('T')[0]
```

### 2. "96" Extracted as First Name
**Problem**: Parser extracting numbers from addresses as names
- Line 17: `\w+` pattern matches digits
- Line 127: `(.+?)\s+says:` was too greedy, capturing entire addresses

**Fixes Applied**:
- Line 17: Changed to `([A-Za-z]+)\s+([A-Za-z]+)` 
- Line 119: Changed to `([A-Za-z]+)\s+([A-Za-z]+)`
- Line 128: Changed to `(?:\.|[0-9])\s+([A-Za-z]+(?:\s+[A-Za-z]+)*)\s+says:`

### 3. Missing "requested an application" Pattern
**Problem**: Victoria Watson emails not parsing correctly

**Fix Applied**: Added new pattern at lines 153-161
```javascript
if (!result.last_name || result.last_name === '') {
  const requestMatch = cleanBody.match(/([A-Za-z]+\s+[A-Za-z]+)\s+requested\s+an?\s+application/i);
  if (requestMatch) {
    const nameParts = requestMatch[1].trim().split(/\s+/);
    result.first_name = nameParts[0];
    result.last_name = nameParts.slice(1).join(' ');
  }
}
```

### 4. Database Cleanup
**Created**: `/backend/repair-bad-leads.js`
- Fixed 6 leads with "96" as first name
- Extracted correct names from malformed last_name field
- All leads now have proper names

## Files Modified

### 1. `/backend/src/parsers/zillowParser.js`
- Line 17: Fixed leadName pattern
- Line 119: Fixed aboutMatch pattern  
- Line 128: Fixed saysMatchOverride pattern
- Lines 153-161: Added requestMatch pattern
- Line 363: Fixed parseDate to keep timestamp

### 2. `/backend/repair-bad-leads.js` (Created)
- Script to fix existing bad data in database
- Successfully repaired all 6 affected leads

### 3. `/backend/test-parser-fixes.js` (Created)
- Comprehensive test suite for all parser fixes
- All tests passing

## Test Results

### Parser Tests
```
✅ Jenna Olsakowski: Correctly parsed (not "96")
✅ Victoria Watson: Correctly parsed with new pattern
✅ Date Format: Keeps full ISO timestamp
✅ Digit Exclusion: Numbers not parsed as names
```

### Database Repair Results
```
✅ Lead 499: Jenna Olsakowski (was "96 New message...")
✅ Lead 534: Zaliyah Meade (fixed)
✅ Lead 504: Heather Trego (fixed)
✅ Lead 511: Audrey Jones (fixed)
✅ Lead 514: Dashawna Heggs (fixed)
✅ Lead 522: Donta Coleman (fixed)
```

### API Verification
- Dates ordered correctly: newest first (2025-08-18 descending)
- No more "96" in database
- API responding quickly (~200ms)

## Remaining Work for Other Claudes

### For Claude 3 (Frontend):
The backend now sends proper ISO timestamps with time. Frontend needs to:
1. Handle future dates properly (show actual date, not "Today")
2. Fix income display logic to respect income_type field
3. Ensure date calculations work with full timestamps

### For Claude 1 (Orchestrator):
1. Verify integration between backend and frontend
2. Test full flow with new email imports
3. Monitor for any edge cases

## Environment State
- Backend running on port 3001
- All parser fixes active
- Database cleaned of bad data
- Single nodemon process running (cleaned up extras)

## How to Continue

### To Test Parser:
```bash
node test-parser-fixes.js
```

### To Re-run Database Repair:
```bash
node -r dotenv/config repair-bad-leads.js
```

### To Check Specific Lead:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/leads/[ID]
```

## Important Notes

1. **User Modification**: After my fixes, the user further improved the parser to extract names from the email 'from' field as a primary source (lines 10-27 in zillowParser.js)

2. **Date Format**: All dates now include full timestamp (e.g., "2025-08-15T14:30:00.000Z") which prevents timezone issues

3. **Parser Priority**: 
   - First: Extract from email 'from' field
   - Second: Check subject patterns
   - Third: Check body patterns
   - Fourth: Fallback patterns

## Session End Status
✅ All backend tasks completed
✅ Database cleaned
✅ Tests passing
✅ Ready for frontend fixes
