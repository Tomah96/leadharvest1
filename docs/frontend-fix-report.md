# Frontend Fix Report - Infinite Loop Resolution

Date: 2025-07-17
Fixed by: Claude 3 (Frontend Expert)

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Infinite Loop (FIXED)
**Location**: `/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
**Problem**: Line 66 was making an API call inside a useEffect that depended on `leadsData`, creating an infinite loop:
- `leadsData` changes → triggers useEffect → makes API call → updates `leadsData` → loop repeats

**Solution**: Removed the nested API call and used the already fetched data for statistics calculation

### 2. useApi Hook Optimization (FIXED)
**Location**: `/frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts`
**Problem**: The `execute` function was being recreated on every render due to `apiFunction` dependency
**Solution**: 
- Added `useRef` to store the API function reference
- Removed `apiFunction` from useCallback dependencies
- This prevents unnecessary re-renders and stabilizes the hook

### 3. Conversations Page Performance (FIXED)
**Location**: `/frontend/src/app/conversations/page.tsx`
**Problem**: 
- Sequential API calls for each lead's message count
- useEffect depending on `leads` array reference causing re-fetches
**Solution**:
- Changed to parallel API calls using Promise.all
- Limited to first 20 leads for performance
- Changed dependency to `leads.length` instead of `leads` array

## Testing

Created a test stability page at `/test-stability` to verify the frontend is working without rapid reloads.

## Summary

All identified infinite loop issues have been resolved:
1. ✅ Dashboard no longer makes nested API calls
2. ✅ useApi hook is now stable and won't cause re-renders
3. ✅ Conversations page fetches are optimized and controlled

The frontend should now be stable and accessible. The Gmail test page at `/test/gmail` should be reachable for testing.

## Next Steps

1. Restart the frontend server to apply all changes
2. Navigate to `/test-stability` to verify stability
3. Test the Gmail integration at `/test/gmail`
4. Monitor console for any remaining errors
