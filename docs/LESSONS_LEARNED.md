# LeadHarvest Project - Lessons Learned

> **Core Philosophy**: Toyota, not BMW. Simple, reliable solutions that work 95% of the time.

## üéØ Key Principles

### 1. **First Principle Thinking**
- What's the ACTUAL problem? (Not what seems to be the problem)
- What's the SIMPLEST solution?
- What tools do we ALREADY have?

### 2. **Incremental Debugging**
- Change ONE thing at a time
- Test after EACH change
- Don't delete everything to "start fresh"

### 3. **Toyota vs BMW Approach**

| Toyota (Right) ‚úÖ | BMW (Wrong) ‚ùå |
|---|---|
| Simple if/else logic | Complex regex patterns |
| Use existing modules | Build custom wrappers |
| Fix the specific problem | Rebuild everything |
| 10 lines of code | 200 lines of code |
| 5-minute fix | 2-hour spiral |

## üìö Daily Lessons

### [Day 8: The NPM/Supabase Incident](./lessons/day8-toyota-not-bmw.md)
**Problem**: Supabase module hanging on import  
**Wrong Solution**: Delete all node_modules, assume NPM broken, build REST wrapper  
**Right Solution**: Remove ONE module from package.json, use existing pg client  
**Time Wasted**: 2+ hours on a 5-minute problem  
**Key Lesson**: Always try the simplest fix first  

### Future Lessons
- Day 9: (To be documented)
- Day 10: (To be documented)

## üö® Red Flags - When to STOP and Reconsider

You're probably overengineering if you:
- Are deleting everything to "start fresh"
- Think core tools (npm, node, git) are "completely broken"
- Are building wrappers/adapters for existing tools
- Need 100+ lines to fix a simple import
- Haven't tried the obvious solution first

**When you see these signs**: STOP. Ask "What's the simplest possible fix?"

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem-Solving Checklist

Before taking any action:
1. ‚úì What's the EXACT error message?
2. ‚úì What's the SMALLEST change that might fix it?
3. ‚úì Do we have existing tools that already solve this?
4. ‚úì Can this be fixed in < 10 lines of code?
5. ‚úì Have I tried the obvious solution?

## üí¨ Communication Patterns

### Good Communication ‚úÖ
"The X module is failing. Let me try removing just that module and use Y instead."

### Bad Communication ‚ùå
"Everything is broken! Let me rebuild the entire system from scratch!"

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Prefer:
- Direct database connections over complex ORMs
- Native Node.js modules over heavy frameworks
- Explicit error handling over clever abstractions
- Clear if/else over complex regex

### Avoid:
- Abstractions that hide what's actually happening
- Dependencies that do too much
- "Clean slate" approaches
- Assuming tools are broken

## üìñ Required Reading

Before working on any "blocking" issue:
1. Read this document
2. Read the specific day's lesson if similar issue
3. Try the 5-minute fix before the 2-hour fix

## üéì Learning from Mistakes

**It's OK to make mistakes**, but we must:
1. Document what went wrong
2. Identify the simpler solution
3. Share with the team
4. Not repeat the same mistake

## üöó Remember: Toyota, Not BMW

- **Reliable** > Clever
- **Simple** > Complex  
- **Working** > Perfect
- **Clear** > Elegant
- **Fast fix** > Complete rewrite
