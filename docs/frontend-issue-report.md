# Frontend Issue Report - Rapid Reloading Problem

Date: 2025-07-17
Reporter: Claude 1 (Orchestrator)
For: Claude 3 (Frontend Expert)

## Issue Description

The frontend application is experiencing rapid page reloading, preventing navigation between pages. The app continuously refreshes and shows errors.

## What I Tried to Fix It

### 1. Authentication Issue (Initial Diagnosis)
**Problem**: API calls were returning 401 Unauthorized errors, causing redirects to `/login`
**Actions Taken**:
- Created `/frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx` - A basic login page that auto-redirects in development
- Modified `/backend/src/middleware/auth.js` - Added development bypass for authentication:
  ```javascript
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    req.user = { id: 'test-user', email: 'test@leadharvest.com' };
    return next();
  }
  ```
- Restarted backend server to apply changes

### 2. API Client Redirect Loop
**Problem**: Frontend API client was still redirecting to `/login` on 401 errors
**Action Taken**:
- Modified `/frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts` (lines 45-52):
  ```typescript
  // TEMPORARILY DISABLED for development
  console.warn("401 Unauthorized - Auth redirect disabled for development");
  // if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  //   window.location.href = "/login";
  // }
  ```

### 3. Created Test Page
**Action**: Created `/frontend/src/app/simple/page.tsx` - A static page with no API calls to isolate the issue

## Current Symptoms

1. **Console Logs Show**:
   - Multiple "Fast Refresh had to perform a full reload" warnings
   - GET requests to "/" taking 3-5+ seconds
   - 404 error for `/simple` page (even though file was created)

2. **Backend Status**:
   - Running on port 3001 ✅
   - Auth bypass active ✅
   - Database connection failing (but shouldn't cause frontend loops)

3. **Frontend Behavior**:
   - Pages compile successfully
   - Rapid reloading preventing interaction
   - Can't navigate to other pages
   - Login redirect disabled but issue persists

## Possible Root Causes

1. **Hot Reload Issue**: Fast Refresh seems to be triggering full page reloads
2. **API Hook Problem**: The `useApi` hook in the dashboard might be causing infinite re-renders
3. **Database Errors**: Failed API calls might be triggering unexpected behavior
4. **Next.js Configuration**: Something in the Next.js setup causing reload loops

## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx` - Created
2. `/frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts` - Disabled auth redirect
3. `/frontend/src/app/simple/page.tsx` - Created for testing
4. `/backend/src/middleware/auth.js` - Added dev bypass

## What Claude 3 Should Investigate

1. **Check the dashboard component** (`/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`):
   - Line 66: `api.leads.getAll({ limit: 100 })` in useEffect might be problematic
   - Multiple API calls on mount

2. **Review `useApi` hook** (`/frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts`):
   - Potential infinite loop in error handling?

3. **Next.js Configuration**:
   - Check if there's a middleware causing redirects
   - Fast Refresh configuration issues

4. **Browser Console**:
   - Need to see actual JavaScript errors
   - Check Network tab for redirect chains

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Disable all API calls temporarily** in the dashboard to confirm it's API-related
2. **Check for Next.js middleware** that might be causing redirects
3. **Add console.log debugging** to track component re-renders
4. **Try production build** (`npm run build && npm run start`) to bypass Fast Refresh

The Gmail test page at `/test/gmail` is critical for today's testing, so getting the frontend stable is priority #1!
