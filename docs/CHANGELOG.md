- Custom hooks for API calls (useApi, usePaginatedApi, useDebounce)
- Loading skeletons and error states throughout
- Lead detail page with full CRUD capabilities
- Inline status updates with real-time feedback
- Search functionality with 500ms debounce
- Functional filters for status, source, and missing info
- Pagination controls with proper page navigation
- 30-second polling for new leads
