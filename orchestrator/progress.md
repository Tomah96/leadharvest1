# Orchestrator Progress Notes - LeadHarvest CRM

## Overview
This document tracks the Orchestrator's activities, decisions, and coordination efforts.

## Day 1 Summary (2025-07-16)
- ✅ Set up multi-Claude development architecture
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation framework
- ✅ Assigned Day 1 tasks to Backend and Frontend teams
- ✅ Both teams successfully completed their foundational tasks
- ✅ Reviewed and validated all Day 1 deliverables

### Key Achievements:
- Backend: Express server, Supabase setup, JWT auth, health endpoint
- Frontend: Next.js 14 setup, complete UI with all pages, API client ready
- Documentation: Complete structure with daily assignments, API contracts, knowledge base

## Day 2 Status (2025-07-17)

### Morning Activities
- ✅ Created Day 2 assignments focused on integration
- ✅ Backend tasks: Lead CRUD API with phone deduplication
- ✅ Frontend tasks: Connect to real backend, remove mock data
- ✅ Defined integration testing plan

### Current Status
- Backend team should be implementing leads API endpoints
- Frontend team should be updating API client for real data
- Monitoring for blockers via blockers-and-issues.md

### Coordination Points
1. Backend must complete leads API by midday for frontend integration
2. Will test integration as soon as both sides are ready
3. End-to-end testing planned for:
   - Lead creation with deduplication
   - Search and filtering
   - Status updates
   - Error handling

### Next Actions
- [ ] Monitor backend API implementation progress
- [ ] Test backend endpoints once available
- [ ] Coordinate frontend integration timing
- [ ] Run integration tests
- [ ] Review and merge feature branches

## Key Decisions Log
1. **Phone-based deduplication**: Primary key for lead matching
2. **API-first approach**: Backend completes endpoints before frontend integration
3. **Incremental testing**: Test each integration point as it becomes available
4. **Documentation-driven**: All coordination through markdown files

## Metrics
- Day 1 completion: 100%
- Day 2 progress: In progress
- Blockers resolved: 0 (none reported)
- Integration points defined: 5
